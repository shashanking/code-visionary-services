This is the **_`dev`_** branch, which contains the final reviewed code before release.  
Once the changes are approved and tested, this branch will be merged into the **_`main`_** branch for deployment.

### Branching Strategy -

- **`main`** — Production branch used for live deployment.
- **`dev`** — Final review branch; only tested and approved code is merged here.
- **purnendu** — Active development happens here. Changes are merged into `dev` after review.
