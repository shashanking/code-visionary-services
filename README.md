# CSV Official

Here it is the official codebase for the website and internal tools.  
This repository follows a structured branching model to ensure smooth and reliable development, testing, and deployment.

---

## ðŸ§­ Branching Strategy

- **`main`** â€” Production branch used for live deployment. Only stable and tested code is merged here.  
- **`dev`** â€” Final review and testing branch. Code from feature branches is merged here after initial review.  
- **`purnendu`** â€” Active development branch where ongoing enhancements and feature work are done before being submitted for review.

## ðŸš€ Development Flow

1. Development happens in the **`purnendu`** branch.  
2. After review and testing, changes are merged into **`dev`**.  
3. Once verified in `dev`, code is merged into **`main`** for deployment.
